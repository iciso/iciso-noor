            <h2>What is CLCP?</h2>
            <p>
              The Community Life Competence Process (CLCP) is an approach developed by The Constellation that empowers
              communities to respond to their challenges. It is based on the belief that communities have the capacity
              to address their own issues and that sustainable change comes from within.
            </p>

            <h2>Key Principles of CLCP</h2>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Community ownership:</strong> Communities take charge of their own responses to challenges
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Strength-based approach:</strong> Focusing on strengths rather than problems
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Learning from experience:</strong> Communities learn from their own and others' experiences
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Local response:</strong> Believing in the capacity of communities to address their own issues
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transfer:</strong> Sharing experiences and practices between communities
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The SALT Approach</h2>
            <p>SALT is a foundational approach in CLCP that stands for Stimulate, Appreciate, Learn, and Transfer:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <strong>Stimulate:</strong> Encouraging communities to reflect on their experiences and potential
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Appreciate:</strong> Recognizing strengths and achievements rather than focusing on problems
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Learn:</strong> Learning from communities and facilitating their learning from each other
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Transfer:</strong> Sharing experiences and practices between communities
              </li>
            </ul>

            <h2>The CLCP Process</h2>
            <p>CLCP follows a systematic process that includes:</p>
            <ol>
              <li>
                <strong>Relationship building:</strong> Establishing trust and connection with communities
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Dream building:</strong> Helping communities envision their desired future
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-assessment:</strong> Communities evaluate their current strengths and challenges
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Action planning:</strong> Developing concrete steps to move toward the dream
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Implementation:</strong> Taking action and learning from the process
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Self-measurement:</strong> Communities track their own progress
              </li>
              <li>
                <strong>Sharing and learning:</strong> Communities share their experiences with others
              </li>
            </ol>

            <h2>CLCP and Faith Traditions</h2>

              Hinduism, and others. These commonalities include:
