# Islam

Islam is a monotheistic religion that follows the teachings of the Prophet Muhammad as recorded in the Quran. It emphasizes the worship of one God (Allah) and adherence to the Five Pillars of Islam:

1. Shahada (faith): Belief in one God and Muhammad as His messenger
2. Salat (prayer): Performing ritual prayers five times daily
3. Zakat (charity): Giving a portion of one's wealth to those in need
4. Sawm (fasting): Fasting during the month of Ramadan
5. Hajj (pilgrimage): Pilgrimage to Mecca at least once in a lifetime if able

The Quran is considered the literal word of God as revealed to Muhammad through the angel Gabriel.

2. The Eightfold Path: Right understanding, intention, speech, action, livelihood, effort, mindfulness, and concentration
